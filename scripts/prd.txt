# Entra ID Authentication Proof of Concept

## Overview
This proof of concept demonstrates a secure authentication implementation using Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) with Next.js and a C# API backend. It showcases best practices for authentication flows in modern applications using the Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern, with proper test coverage through Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Core Features

### 1. Next.js Frontend with Server Components
- Implement a modern Next.js application using React Server Components
- Create protected and public routes with proper authentication handling
- Demonstrate efficient component architecture with auth-aware components
- Provide clean separation between authenticated and unauthenticated states

### 2. Auth.js Integration
- Implement Auth.js v4 provider for Entra ID integration
- Showcase session management and token handling
- Implement proper security practices for token storage
- Demonstrate migration path to Auth.js v5 with key differences highlighted

### 3. Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Pattern
- Implement secure token forwarding from frontend to backend
- Handle token lifecycle (acquisition, refresh, validation)
- Prevent token exposure to client browser
- Demonstrate proper CSRF protection

### 4. C# API with JWT Validation
- Create minimal API endpoints with authentication requirements
- Implement proper JWT validation and claims extraction
- Demonstrate role-based and claims-based authorization
- Showcase proper error handling for authentication failures

### 5. Test-Driven Development Approach
- Comprehensive test suite for both frontend and backend components
- Unit tests for auth-specific logic
- Integration tests for auth flows
- Mock strategies for testing auth-dependent components
- CI pipeline configuration for automated testing

## User Experience
- **Developer Persona**: Application developers needing to implement secure Entra ID authentication
- **Key Flows**: 
  - Authentication process (login, session management, logout)
  - Protected resource access
  - API authorization
- **UX Considerations**:
  - Clear authentication state indicators
  - Proper error handling for auth failures
  - Smooth login/logout transitions

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
- Next.js frontend application (TypeScript)
- C# .NET API backend
- Auth.js authentication provider
- Entra ID tenant configuration

### Data Models
- User profile information
- JWT token structure
- Authentication session model

### APIs and Integrations
- Entra ID OAuth endpoints
- Protected API endpoints
- Auth.js provider integration

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Monorepo structure for frontend and backend
- Shared type definitions between frontend and backend
- Development environment with proper Entra ID configuration
- Testing infrastructure with auth mocking capabilities

## Development Roadmap

### MVP Requirements
1. **Project Setup & Configuration**
   - Monorepo structure setup
   - Next.js application scaffolding with TypeScript
   - C# API project configuration
   - Development environment configuration

2. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Frontend testing setup (Jest, React Testing Library)
   - Backend testing setup (xUnit)
   - Auth mocking utilities
   - CI pipeline configuration

3. **Auth.js v4 Implementation**
   - Entra ID provider configuration
   - Session handling implementation
   - Protected route implementation

4. **C# API with JWT Authentication**
   - JWT validation middleware
   - Protected API endpoints
   - Claims extraction and usage

5. **BFF Pattern Implementation**
   - Secure token forwarding
   - API request handling with auth
   - CSRF protection

6. **Integration & End-to-End Testing**
   - Full authentication flow testing
   - API access with authentication
   - Error handling and edge cases

### Future Enhancements
1. **Auth.js v5 Migration**
   - Update configuration for v5
   - Leverage new v5 features
   - Document migration process

2. **Advanced Auth Scenarios**
   - Role-based access control
   - Conditional access policies
   - Multi-tenant support

3. **Enhanced Developer Experience**
   - Detailed documentation
   - Reusable components and hooks
   - Performance optimizations

## Logical Dependency Chain
1. Project setup and testing infrastructure (foundation)
2. Basic authentication with Auth.js v4 and Entra ID (core functionality)
3. Protected API implementation with C# (backend security)
4. BFF pattern implementation (secure communication)
5. Integration testing of complete flows (verification)
6. Auth.js v5 migration (enhancement)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Complexity of Entra ID configuration and OAuth flows
  - **Mitigation**: Start with minimal configuration, expand gradually with tests

- **Risk**: Secure implementation of BFF pattern
  - **Mitigation**: Follow established patterns, implement comprehensive security tests

- **Risk**: Auth.js version differences
  - **Mitigation**: Clear separation between v4 and v5 implementations, with migration documentation

### Development Challenges
- **Risk**: Testing authentication flows can be complex
  - **Mitigation**: Invest in proper mocking strategies and test utilities upfront

- **Risk**: Coordination between frontend and backend components
  - **Mitigation**: Define clear interfaces and shared types from the beginning
